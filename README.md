## Theory

### Intervals

Major second = 2 semitones  
Minor third = 3 semitones  
Major third = 4 semitones  
Perfect fourth = 5 semitones  

### 3 notes chords

| Chord | Notes | Notation |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Major | 1, 3, 5 | C |
| minor | 1, 3m, 5 | Cm |
| disminished | 1, 3m, 5- | C- |
| augmented | 1, 3, 5+ | C+ |
| suspended | 1, 2, 5 | Csus2 |
| suspended | 1, 4, 5 | Csus4 |

## Scales

We assume we know all the notes of the scale.  
To know what scale we are in, we got two solutions :
* __Sharps__ : The last sharp (#) is the sensible (7th) of the scale (major). 
  Ex: F#, C# -> D maj
* __Flats__ : The second to last flat (b) is the root of the scale (major).
  Ex: Bb, Eb &rarr Bb maj
      Bb &rarr Fb maj

### equivalence major/minor scale
Major &rarr minor : lower the root of a tone and a half
Minor &rarr major : raise the root of a tone and a half
